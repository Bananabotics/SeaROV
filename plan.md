what we need to do
mount electronics box
- my idea is to cut a slot out of it and bolt it on upside down

mount sub frame made of pvc
- my idea is to use a pvc frame thats a cube
- drill holes in it so it is negatively buoyant. 
- put heavy stuff on bottom, some metal frame there. 
- make the arm and mount on the bottom half

finish initial wiring
- esc's to motors and then to the i2c board
- cameras need to be epoxied
- need to find cables blocks for waterproofing the box safely


key points
- document everything
- get the motors connected to the pi and have an ethernet controlled master slave between laptop and pi by end of week
- have box bolted and mounted to the frame.
